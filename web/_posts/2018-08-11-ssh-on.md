This post will show you how to connect to a cattlepi managed device using SSH.
We assume that you've already gone through the [Hello CattlePi Tutorial]({% post_url 2018-08-10-hello-cattlepi %}) and have your account and default boot target config.

<!--more-->
A few considerations before we get started: 
* in the image that you're using the SSH daemon should be running, but it's configured to not allow password logins (see https://github.com/cattlepi/cattlepi/blob/master/builder/tasks/squashfs.yml#L29). It also does not allow empty passwords or the root user login in (keep in mind that the **pi** user does have sudo though)
* by default we don't have any ssh keys baked in into the image for the pi used 
* the host ssh keys are regenerated on boot (if you reboot a cattlepi device the ssh client will complain that the server key has changed - this is normal - actually this is expected)

Now, how do we connect? It turns out that there is a hook in the device configuration that allows you to inject keys that are authorized to connect as the pi user (technically inject public keys and need to separately have the private key). 

The code responsible for this is [here](https://github.com/cattlepi/cattlepi/blob/2c2d2100c8538f8df34adb31c1db1c2004f152da/templates/raspbian/resources/bin/bootstrap.sh#L12).  
You can observe that if an array is present at **config.ssh.pi.authorized_keys** in the configuration that is served to the device, each element in that array will get injected into the authorized keys. 
In the [demo server](https://github.com/cattlepi/cattlepi/blob/master/server/server.py#L44) we see one way you can generate the config. For the sake of simplicity and brevity we will do this using api.cattlepi.com and we will update the config via curl. 

```bash
PAYLOAD='{"config":{"ssh":{"pi":{"authorized_keys":["'$(head -1 $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)'"]}}},"initfs":{"md5sum":"8e0e2870637e77462b40b8fe67c6d91b", "url":"https://api.cattlepi.com/images/global/raspbian-lite/2018-06-29/v4/initramfs.tgz"},"rootfs":{"md5sum":"0826222b56df3d074fa4b21fd4b9d891","url":"https://api.cattlepi.com/images/global/raspbian-lite/2018-06-29/v4/rootfs.sqsh"}}'
curl -vvv -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-Api-Key: 8db071a4-63ef-47f7-9cfc-ca479b5422da" \
    -X POST -d "$PAYLOAD" \
    https://api.cattlepi.com/boot/default/config
```

The payload is the same with the exception that the authorized keys are now injected. Notice how the id_rsa.pub is picked up and injected in the config. You can inject any keys you want - this serves as an example. You can also have multiple keys as authorized_keys is an array.

To retrieve the config and inspect it:
```bash
{
  "bootcode": "",
  "config": {
    "ssh": {
      "pi": {
        "authorized_keys": [
          "ssh-rsa actual_base64_encodedkey email@test.com"
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "initfs": {
    "md5sum": "8e0e2870637e77462b40b8fe67c6d91b",
    "url": "https://api.cattlepi.com/images/global/raspbian-lite/2018-06-29/v4/initramfs.tgz"
  },
  "rootfs": {
    "md5sum": "0826222b56df3d074fa4b21fd4b9d891",
    "url": "https://api.cattlepi.com/images/global/raspbian-lite/2018-06-29/v4/rootfs.sqsh"
  },
  "usercode": ""
}
```

Now, reboot the Pi and attempt connecting to it:
```
ssh pi@192.168.1.87
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.87 (192.168.1.87)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

You can not connect to the device. 
While we are here let's take a look in /cattlepi dir:
```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~$ ls -lah /cattlepi/

drwxr-xr-x 1 root root  120 Aug 11 20:32 .

```bash

    }

You can see what your api key is, you can see the api endpoint and the configuration from within the running Pi.
